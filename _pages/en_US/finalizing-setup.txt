#### Overview of steps

{% capture notice-2 %}

The file `boot.firm` is what is launched by boot9strap itself after it finishes loading off of NAND, and can be any valid arm9 payload in the FIRM format. This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads in the FIRM format using the Luma3DS chainloader.
<br><br>
In this case, we use Luma3DS by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/) to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.
<br><br>
During this process, we also setup programs such as the following:    

+  **Themely** *(installs custom themes)*
+  **Luma3DS Updater** *(updates your CFW installation easily)*
+  **GodMode9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}</div>

#### What you need

* The latest release of [Themely](https://github.com/ihaveamac/Themely/releases/latest) *(the `.cia` file)*
* The latest release of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest)
* The latest fork of [Luma3DS Updater](https://github.com/KunoichiZ/lumaupdate/releases/latest) *(the `.cia` file)*

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Prep Work

1. Power off your device
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Create a folder named `cias` on the root of your SD card if it does not already exist
1. Copy `lumaupdater.cia` to the `/cias/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `FBI.cia` to the `/cias/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `Themely.cia` to the `/cias/` folder on your SD card
1. Create a folder named `payloads` in the `luma` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `GodMode9.firm` from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy the `gm9` folder from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Delete the 0.23.5 SystemUpdater folder from the root of your SD card
1. Extract the 0.25.3 SystemUpdater `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device

##### Section III - Updating the System

This section is optional and requires both a CTR flash card and the development hardware to write a CSU to that CTR flash card.
{: .notice--info}

1. Update your PANDA unit by using the latest version CTR System Updater (CSU) available to you
  + **This is only safe for Luma3DS version 6.6 (commit 0b16d88) and above!**
  + **Attempting to update your PANDA using a CSU on any lower Luma3DS version will overwrite your B9S installation!**

##### Section VI - CTRNAND Luma3DS

1. Reboot holding (Start) during boot to launch GodMode9
1. Navigate to `[0:] SDCARD`
1. Press (Y) on `boot.firm` to copy it
1. Press (B) to return to the main menu
1. Navigate to `[1:] SYSNAND CTRNAND`
1. Press (Y) to paste a copy of `boot.firm`
1. Select "Copy path(s)"
1. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND (lvl1) writing, then input the key combo given
1. Press (B) to return to the main menu
1. Navigate to `[0:] SDCARD`
1. Press (Y) on the `luma` folder to copy it
1. Press (B) to return to the main menu
1. Navigate to `[1:] SYSNAND CTRNAND` -> `rw`
1. Press (Y) to paste a copy of the `luma` folder from your SD card
1. Select "Copy path(s)"

##### Section V - NAND Backup

1. Boot your device while holding (Start) to launch the Luma3DS chainloader menu
1. Launch GodMode9 by pressing (A)
1. When prompted to create an essential files backup, press (A) to do so, then press (A) to continue once it has completed
1. Press (Home) to bring up the action menu
1. Select "More..."
1. Select "Scripts"
1. Select "Backup SysNAND"
1. Press (A) to confirm
  + This process will take some time
1. Press (A) to continue
1. Hold (R) and press (B) at the same time to eject your SD card
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy `<serialnumber>_nandmin_###.bin` from the `/gm9/out/` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your computer
  + Make backups in multiple locations (such as online file storage)
  + This backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong in the future
1. Delete `<serialnumber>_nandmin_###.bin` from the `/gm9/out/` folder on your SD card after copying it
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot

You will now boot Luma3DS CFW SysNAND by default.    
You can now hold (Select) on boot to launch the Luma3DS configuration menu.    
You can now hold (Start) on boot to launch the Luma3DS chainloader menu (note that the Luma3DS chainloader menu is only displayed if there is more than one payload detected).    
You can now hold (Start) + (Select) + (X) on boot to dump the ARM11 bootrom (`boot11.bin`), the ARM9 bootrom (`boot9.bin`), and your console unique OTP (`OTP.bin`) to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card (note that this will not have any kind of prompt or message).    
You can now press (L) + (Down) + (Select) while the system is booted to open the Rosalina menu integrated into Luma3DS. For a full list of Rosalina features, please see the [Luma3DS v8.0 Release](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/releases/tag/v8.0)
