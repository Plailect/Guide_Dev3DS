If you already flashed ntrboot to your flashcart, you can follow [Installing boot9strap (ntrboot)](installing-boot9strap-(ntrboot)) for instructions on how to use it.

### Required Reading

Installing boot9strap with ntrboot requires a compatible DS / DSi flashcart to flash ntrboot to.

The ntrboot exploit itself is compatible with the following flashcarts:

  + [R4i Gold 3DS (RTS)](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149)
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160)
  + R4i Gold 3DS "Starter"
  + R4i Ultra
  + R4 3D Revolution
  + Infinity 3 R4i
  + DSTT ([some flash chips only!](https://gist.github.com/Hikari-chin/6b48f1bb8dd15136403c15c39fafdb42))

  {: .notice--info}

Note that specific methods may have additional compatibility information.

The usage of this exploit, regardless of flashing method, requires access to a small magnet if the target device is of a folding style (any 3DS family system that is not the old 2DS with a sleep switch). This is because the exploit requires your device to enter sleep mode while still having access to the buttons.

To test if a magnet will work, hold it on or around the (A)(B)(X)(Y) buttons while the device is powered on to see if it triggers sleep mode. If it does, both displays will go black as long as the magnet is held in that spot.
{: .notice--info}

Note that the flashcart will not be able to be used for its standard functions while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it (except for in the case of the Acekard 2i, which remains functional *on 3DS systems with custom firmware installed only*). There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot flashing instructions to remove it from your flashcart when you are done.

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))

### Methods

___

#### Flashing ntrboot (3DS Single System)

This method requires nothing more than your stock unhacked 3DS and a compatible flashcart.

Note that more recent 3DS versions have blocked access to some flashcarts, and some flashcarts have always been blocked on the 3DS. This leaves them unable to launch the flasher `.nds` file on some (or all) versions. The ntrboot compatible flashcarts are able to launch `.nds` files on the 3DS (under the listed versions):

  + [R4i Gold 3DS (RTS)](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149) : <= 11.6.0
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160) : <= 4.3.0
  + R4i Gold 3DS "Starter" : 4.1.0 - 4.5.0
  + R4i Ultra : <= 4.3.0
  + Infinity 3 R4i : <= 11.6.0

Continue to [Flashing ntrboot (3DS Single System)](flashing-ntrboot-(3ds-single-system))
{: .notice--primary}

___

#### Flashing ntrboot (3DS Multi System)

This method requires temporary access to a second 3DS family device that is already running boot9strap.

Continue to [Flashing ntrboot (3DS Multi System)](flashing-ntrboot-(3ds-multi-system))
{: .notice--primary}

___

#### Flashing ntrboot (NDS)

This method requires temporary access to a Nintendo DS or Nintendo DS Lite that is compatible with your flashcart.

Continue to [Flashing ntrboot (NDS)](flashing-ntrboot-(nds))
{: .notice--primary}

___

#### Flashing ntrboot (DSi)

This method requires temporary access to a Nintendo DSi that is compatible with your flashcart.

Note that more recent DSi versions have blocked access to some flashcarts. This leaves them unable to launch the flasher `.nds` file on newer versions. The ntrboot compatible flashcarts are able to launch `.nds` files under the following versions:

  + [R4i Gold 3DS RTS](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149) : <= 1.4.5
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160) : <= 1.4.4
  + R4i Gold 3DS "Starter" : <= 1.4.5
  + R4i Ultra : <= 1.4.1
  + Infinity 3 R4i : <= 1.4.5

Continue to [Flashing ntrboot (DSi)](flashing-ntrboot-(dsi))

#### Flashing ntrboot (Powersaves)

This method, once ready, will require temporary access to a [Powersaves](https://amzn.to/2fb3VY7). This method is not yet complete, and as such is just a placeholder page.
