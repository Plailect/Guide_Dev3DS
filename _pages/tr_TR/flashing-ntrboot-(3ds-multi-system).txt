Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

Note that R4i Gold 3DS RTS flashcarts will not be able to be used for their standard functions (such as launching `.nds` files) while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it. This does not apply to the Acekard 2i.

There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot boot9strap installation instructions to remove the ntrboot exploit from your flashcart when you are done.

This method requires temporary access to a second 3DS family device that is already running some kind of custom firmware (such as boot9strap or arm9loaderhax). It is compatible with the following flashcarts:

  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160)
  + [R4i Gold 3DS RTS](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149)

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
