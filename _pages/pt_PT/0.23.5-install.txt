#### Overview of steps

- Install the version 0.23.5 for your region / device

___

There are two different methods of installing the version 0.23.5 onto your PANDA unit.

One method requires no external tools but only supports some regions and devices due to missing CIA packs for the remaining regions and devices.

The other method supports all regions and devices, but requires a CTR flash card and the necessary development hardware to write a CSU to that CTR flash card.
