This page is for existing arm9loaderhax users to update their devices to boot9strap.

All future releases of Luma3DS will only be made in the `.firm` format, which will only be compatible with boot9strap and sighax. This means that to continue receiving the latest updates of Luma3DS, you should use this page to update your installation.

To use the [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)

If you have a PIN enabled on Luma3DS, SafeB9SInstaller will give you an "OTP Crypto Fail" error unless you temporarily disable your PIN (you can re-enable the PIN after the update).

#### What you need

Note that the following required file named `secret_sector_dev.bin` is the same one that was found in `safea9lhinstaller_v2_panda.zip` with the name `secret_sector.bin`. If you already have that file on your disk somewhere, you can use that one (renaming it) instead of downloading the one below.
{: .notice--info}

Note that, only on New 3DS, `secret_sector_dev.bin` is needed to revert the arm9loaderhax exploit, which is why it is not needed for the installation of boot9strap on a stock console.
